==>INTRODUCTION TO THE REPO<==
--------
==>This Directory contains the scripts and files that has been written according to the order of projects

==>All files were uploaded from the terminal.

==>The tasks are for C programming language

==>Focus of the project is on C functions, nested functions and loops

==>BELOW ARE THE LIST OF PROJECTS AND THIER DESCRIPTIONS<==
