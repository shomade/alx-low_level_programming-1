# INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT
#
-> This is the readme file for the 10th Project in ALX low level programming and this is why it is important to learn every step and everything.

-> All files were created and uploaded with Git bash

-> Vim Editor was used in the editing of the files.

-> In this project the following files were created.

	-> 0-sum_them_all.c

	-> 1-print_numbers.c

# PROGRAMMING QUOTES
#
-> “Assembly, while extremely powerful, is simply too difficult to program large applications and hard to read or interpret in a logical way. C is a compiled language, which creates fast and efficient executable files. It is also a small "what you see is all you get" language:” ― Wiki Books, C Programming

-> “Unlike most computer languages, C allows the programmer to write directly to memory. Key constructs in C such as structs, pointers and arrays are designed to structure, and manipulate memory in an efficient, machine-independent fashion.”
― Wiki Books, C Programming

# CONCLUSION
#
-> ALX is preapring us for the future and we are absolutely happy and grateful for it.
